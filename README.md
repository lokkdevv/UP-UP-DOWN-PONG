# UP UP DOWN PONG

**UP UP DOWN PONG** takes the original Pong and twists it with **GTA style cheat codes**.

During a match, you can type input sequences in real time to activate cheats that **stun your opponent**. These cheats aren’t free power ups, they introduce a **risk–reward system**, where every advantage comes with a downside.

Use a cheat at the right moment and you can turn the match around.  
Use it carelessly and you might hand the point away.

The core game stays classic Pong. The strategy comes from deciding **when cheating is worth the risk**.
